# ForgeRunner

**A supercharged Foundry template with automated ABI package publishing and more developer-friendly features.**

ForgeRunner extends the standard Foundry toolkit with production-ready features for smart contract development and deployment workflows.

More handy scripts, Makefile commands, and developer tools coming soon ‚òï

## Key Features

### üì¶ Automated ABI Package Publishing
Automatically extract and publish your contract ABIs as versioned npm packages. Perfect for:
- Frontend integration with type safety
- Multi-repository dApp architectures  
- Maintaining ABI version history with detailed changelogs

See [abis-package/README.md](./abis-package/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Developer Experience
- Pre-configured Makefile with helpful commands
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- Structured project layout

### üöÄ Quick Start

```shell
# Standard Foundry commands
$ forge build
$ forge test
$ forge fmt

# ABI Package commands
$ make abi-build          # Build ABI package locally
$ make abi-build-local    # Build with auth (for testing)
$ make abi-setup-local    # Setup local auth config
```
